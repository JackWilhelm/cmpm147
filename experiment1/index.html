				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is a simple starter generator that makes bad horror movie ideas based on a template and set of words. The user can reroll the words by pressing the gray button.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Based on a collection of words an a template, the program randomly places each word into its corresponding spot. For example for the description of the killer, it will take a random
					choice from the choices available, and insert it into the template.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Jack Wilhelm - This was a fairly simple project and I made use of a lot of what I learned from CMPM 169 as we used a similar formatting for our experiments and website.
					I got to work with something I enjoy (horror movies) and kind of critique certain aspects of them and how the seemingly ridiculous plots of some look odd on paper can actually turn out 
					to be great pieces of media. And I also referenced some horror movies like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and my all time favorite, Christine. If you generate a couple of entries you'll notice
					that all of the victims names are women and this is due to the fact that most horror movies have female protagonists so I thought I'd play to that fact.
