				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This program is made to imitate inpirationaol pieces of artwork and which is this case is notable comic book covers including the first appearances of Spider-Man and Superman. Use the mutation slider to apply a greater or lesser mutation to the generated pieces.
					And use the drop down to change between art pieces.
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>First an array of objects with 3 x,y coordinates are generated to represent triangles. These triangles are then placed onto the art piece. The fill color of each triangle is based on the centroid of the triangle and the color of the pixel at the centroids coordinate 
					on the original art piece. To make certain colors pop, colors with higher saturation have a higher alpha which allows them to be a bit more prominent in the art.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Jack Wilhelm - This project was a nice break from the norm because we got more of a chance to appreciate other famous works of art on break down the notable features of those art pieces to find a kind of common ground that our program can 
					work on. Thats why I wanted to highlight the more saturated colors because I wanted to really highlight the superheros costume colors in a mirage of duller surrounding colors like the Spider-Man cover so that his colors really pop out beneath the surrounding/overlapping gray 
					triangles. If I had more time I would have worked more with the colors closer to black because if the centroid lands on a black drawn line it's going to make a large black triangle. The difficulty is that some comic covers have a lot of notable black which shouldn't be avoided
					like the Incredible Hulk cover and the Spawn cover (whose costume is mostly black). I really enjoyed getting the chance to work with basic polygons (especially triangles) because I find something very mesmerizing about making something with basic shapes much like some 
					of my work in Creative Coding in which I did a similar triangles to art program.
