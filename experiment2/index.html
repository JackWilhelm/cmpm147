				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This generator is based of an image of a road with trees along it's path heading towards mountains surrounded by blue clouds and a golden sky. This project aims to recreate similar kinds of compositions and colors in a random manner.</p>

				<img src="Scenic Photo.jpg" alt="Original Image">
				<p>Relation to inspring image:</p>

<p>- Color: The color of the trees, mountains, clouds, road, and grass were taken from the original image using an eyedropper tool. The colors for the mountains, trees, and clouds are then adjusted randomly by a certain degree to create different, but close, colors. </p>
<p>- Primitives: The trees and clouds are made using triangle and ellipse primatives.</p>
<p>- Polygons: The background mountains were made using polygons made of random vertexes along a path. Each mountain range is one polygon.</p>
<p>- Composition: The position of the trees and clouds, and the shape of the mountains a generated randomly while the road and line are made at the center of the art.</p>
<p>- Life: The trees move along the sides of the road from the mountains, as well as the road line, towards the camera to simulate moving down the road. The clouds move slowly sideways to simulate a constant wind.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The colors of the mountains, trees, and clouds are taken from the actual image and randomly varied to a certain degree for each instance. The trees move along the sides of the road based on time as well as the clouds moving sideways. The mountains are generated using random vertexes along a path.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Working with the colors to make the composition seem more random was really fun to mess around with to make the project more vivid. There were some difficulties making the trees move along the sides of the road as well as scaling up as they moved towards the "camera" and making them spawn only from the mountain ranges. Adding the clouds was also very fun as I got to twiddle with motion as the clouds move sideways as compared to the trees. Using the eye-squint test Im please with how to project turned out compared to the original image.</p>
